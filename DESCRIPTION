Description: RegBinEspacial implements a spatial binary regression model for area data, using a class of 
     flexible link functions that include an extra shape parameter that can conveniently adapt to the degree of 
     asymmetry present in the data. The codes provided were written in R and also in C++ to optimize computational 
     efficiency through the R package Rcpp.
