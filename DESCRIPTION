Description: `RegBinEspacial` implements a spatial binary regression model for area data, using a class of 
flexible link functions that include an extra shape parameter that can conveniently adapt to the degree of 
asymmetry present in the data. The codes provided were written in R and also in C++ to optimize computational 
efficiency through the R package `Rcpp`.
